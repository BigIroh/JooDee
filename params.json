{"note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"#JooDee#\r\nJooDee is a replacement for PHP or ASP using Node.js javascript. To use JooDee, embed server-side javascript on web \r\npages using special tags.  Write to the page using plain HTML outside of the JooDee tags, or using the special output \r\ntag. End the response (if you are running any asyncrhonous code) using Response.end().\r\n\r\nEasily use server-side javascript variables in your client-side javascript using the built in\r\nClient and Session objects.\r\n\r\n##Dependencies##\r\nJooDee depends on `syntax-error` and `mime`, both of which are packaged inside of `node_modules`.\r\n\r\n##Tags##\r\nGeneral purpose server-side script tag\r\n```\r\n    <:\r\n        var code = 'goes here';\r\n    :>\r\n```\r\n\r\nShortcut for Response.write(), writes the evaluated code to the page.  Must be outside of script tags.\r\n```\r\n    <:: must('evaluate') + ' to a js string' :>\r\n```\r\n\r\nIncludes a .html or .joo file\r\n```\r\n    <::: file/path/here.joo :>\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Special variables##\r\nThe variables `Client` and `Session` are available to you server-side and client-side.  \r\nAdd attributes to them to make use of them.<br>\r\n```\r\n    <:\r\n        Client.x = 5;\r\n        Session.username = \"Iroh\";\r\n    :>\r\n    \r\n    <script type=\"application/javascript\"> \r\n        alert(Session.username + Client.x); //will alert Iroh5\r\n    </script>\r\n```\r\nYou also have access to the variable `Page`, which is a static single variable that is \r\nspecific to a given page, as well as `GET` and `POST`, which hold the GET or POST data\r\nsent in the request.  These three variables, `Page`, `GET`, and `POST` are available server-side,\r\nbut you can easily expose them to the client:\r\n```\r\n    <:\r\n        Client.GET = GET;\r\n        Client.POST = POST;\r\n    :>\r\n    \r\n    <script type=\"application/javascript\">\r\n        console.log(Client.GET);\r\n    </script>\r\n    \r\n```\r\nNote: changes to any of these special variables client-side will not be reflected server-side,\r\nwith the exception of `Session` (and even those changes would require the page to be reloaded).<br>\r\n`Server` and `Page` are variables which are shared either across the entire server, or scoped to\r\nall instances of a particular page.  For example, to keep track of the number of views on a particular\r\npage since the server started up, you could write:\r\n```\r\n<:\r\n    if(!Page.userCount) Page.views++\r\n:>\r\n```\r\n`Server` acts in a similar matter, except that it is a single variable accessable to all pages.\r\n##LongFeng##\r\nLongFeng is a program for creating and controlling JooDee instances. It initially \r\ncreates them based on the `config.json` file.\r\n```\r\n    [\r\n        {\r\n    \t\t\"name\": \"JooDee\",\r\n    \t\t\"dir\": \"./demo/\",\r\n    \t\t\"port\": 8080,\r\n    \t\t\"debug\": true,\r\n    \t\t\"defaultPage\": \"joodee.joo\",\r\n    \t\t\"timeout\": 0\r\n    \t},\r\n        {\r\n        \t\"name\": \"JooDee2\",\r\n    \t\t\"dir\": \"./demo2/\",\r\n    \t\t\"port\": 8081,\r\n    \t\t\"debug\": false,\r\n    \t\t\"defaultPage\": \"joodee.joo\",\r\n    \t\t\"timeout\": 0\r\n    \t}\r\n    ]\r\n```\r\nIt gives a console interface for controlling all of the JooDee instances.\r\n```\r\n    Command List:\r\n       close\r\n       listen\r\n       kill\r\n       load\r\n       reload\r\n       exit\r\n    \r\n    Type a \"?\" and a command to learn more about it.\r\n```\r\nSince `joodee.js` is only a module, `longfeng.js` is currently the easiest way to deploy and use your sites. To use `longfeng.js` just add your project's options object to the `config.json` file and run\r\n```\r\n    node longfeng.js\r\n```\r\n\r\n##Demo##\r\n```\r\n    node demo.js\r\n```\r\nnavigate to `127.0.0.1:8081` in your browser.\r\n\r\n##Async Demo##\r\nThis demonstrates one way of how to build a page when async calls are involved. <br>\r\n```\r\n    node async-demo.js\r\n```\r\nnavigate to `127.0.0.1:8082` in your browser.\r\n","name":"JooDee","tagline":"Node.js embedded in HTML","google":"UA-37002569-1"}
